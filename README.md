All the examples contained in this project are for Python 2.x . Since Python 2.x is still very popular I have decided to create this project but if you are following
this project as gudeline for learning, I strongly recommend you to have a look to the project python3_examples.

The code tries to be as intuitive and ilustrative as possible. The scripts are numered in order of difficulty, like a tutorial would do.
